[00:30.000] Stuck inside these four walls, sent inside forever
[00:49.000] Never seeing no one, nice again
[01:00.000] Like you, Mama, you, Mama, you
[01:30.000] Never ever get out of here
[01:50.000] Thought of giving it all away
[01:53.000] To a registered charity
[01:56.000] All I need is a pint a day
[01:58.000] If I ever get out of here
[02:01.000] If we ever get out of here
[02:20.000] Well the rain exploded with a mighty crash
[02:24.000] As we fell into the sun
[02:28.000] And the first one said to the second one there
[02:32.000] I hope you're having fun
[02:36.000] Band on the run
[02:40.000] Band on the run
[02:43.000] And the jailer man
[02:45.000] And sailor Sam
[02:47.000] We're searching everyone
[02:50.000] For the band on the run
[02:54.000] Band on the run
[02:58.000] For the band on the run
[03:02.000] Band on the run
[03:06.000] Well the undertaker drew a heavy sigh
[03:10.000] Seeing no one ever come
[03:13.000] And a bell was ringing in the village square
[03:17.000] For the rapids on the run
[03:21.000] Band on the run
[03:25.000] Band on the run
[03:29.000] And the jailer man
[03:31.000] And sailor Sam
[03:33.000] We're searching everyone
[03:36.000] For the band on the run
[03:40.000] Band on the run
[03:47.000] Band on the run
[03:51.000] Band on the run
[03:55.000] Band on the run
[03:58.000] Band on the run
[04:02.000] Band on the run
[04:05.000] Band on the run
[04:08.000] Band on the run
[04:12.000] Well the night was falling
[04:15.000] Falling as the desert world began to settle down
[04:21.000] In the town they're searching for us everywhere
[04:25.000] But we never will be found
[04:29.000] Fan on the run
[04:33.000] Fan on the rush
[04:37.000] And the county judge
[04:41.000] Tell the grud
[04:45.000] We'll search forever more for the
[04:49.000] Fan on the run
[04:53.000] Fan on the run
[04:57.000] Fan on the run
[05:01.000] Fan on the run
