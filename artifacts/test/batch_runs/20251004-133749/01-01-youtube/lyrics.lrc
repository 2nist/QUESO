[00:00.000] One is the light
[00:28.800] That you have
[00:38.000] Shining all around you
[00:49.200] Is it chemically derived?
[00:57.600] Can't it be natural?
[01:08.400] Something floating from inside
[01:16.799] Shining all around you
[01:27.599] It's potential
[01:36.000] Look into space

[01:45.600] Love is the place
[01:49.200] That you're drawn to
[01:55.200] Look into space
[01:58.800] It surrounds you
[02:04.800] Love is the place
[02:08.400] That you're drawn to
[02:38.400] Look into space
[02:42.000] It surrounds you
[02:48.000] Love is the place
[02:51.599] That you're drawn to
[02:57.599] Look into space
[03:01.200] It surrounds you
[03:07.200] Love is the place
[03:10.800] That you're drawn to
[03:16.800] What is the light
[03:26.400] That you have
[03:36.000] Shining all around you
[03:46.800] Is it chemically derived?
