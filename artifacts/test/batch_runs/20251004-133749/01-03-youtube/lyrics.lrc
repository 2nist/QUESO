[00:00.000] I once had a life
[00:29.600] Or rather, life had me
[00:33.200] I was one among many
[00:36.600] Or at least I seem to be
[00:40.000] But I read an old quotation
[00:43.600] In a book just yesterday
[00:46.600] Said I wanna read but there's a what
[00:49.000] To solve the debt you make
[00:51.600] You'll have to pay
[00:53.400] Can you get the pay?
[00:55.000] Can you get?
[00:57.000] I wanna know
[00:58.200] I wanna know if you can get the line
[01:01.600] Can you get?
[01:05.000] I wanna know if you can get the line
[01:07.600] I recollect with a mixed emotion
[01:11.200] All of the time we used to have
[01:14.200] But you were making preparations
[01:16.200] For the common separation
[01:18.000] And you blew everything we had
[01:21.200] You based your love on credit
[01:24.200] And in your love in days of dawn
[01:26.260] Days are dull, tips you slime with love and kisses
[01:30.400] Later come back, sign in sufficient form
[01:34.420] I'm running low in love and days are dull
[01:38.600] I wanna know if you can get the line
[01:41.600] Can you get?
[01:45.600] I wanna know if you can get the line
[01:48.600] Can you get?
[01:52.600] I wanna know if you can get the line
[01:55.600] Can you get?
[01:58.600] I wanna know if you can get the line
[02:01.600] Can you get?
[02:05.600] I wanna know if you can get the line
[02:08.600] When you base your life on credit
[02:11.600] And your love in days of dawn
[02:14.600] Take shoes, sign with love and kisses
[02:17.620] Kissing later come back, sign in sufficient forms
[02:21.600] You'll get the pay
[02:23.599] Can you get?
[02:26.599] I wanna know if you can get the line
[02:29.599] Can you get?
[02:33.599] I wanna know if you can get the line

[02:40.599] I wanna know if you can get the line
